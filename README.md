# Practice-Project
 WIP Text Adventure Game

# Progress of the Project
Currently the Project is very unfinished in terms of it's story and what not. However I was able to include a good number of mechanics such as:
- Custom Player Name
- Music that loops
- Smooth Character Movement
- A Menu for Multiple Paths
- Text "Blips" (Currently Commented Out as they act a little weird)
